# Calculate Neural Complexity in Python with JAX

Python implementation of the Neural Complexity algorithm, a measure of the complexity of a neural network from it's activation records.
Inspired by the work of Larry Yaeger and his [PolyWorld](https://github.com/polyworld/polyworld) project.

## Usage
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Or if you are using conda:
```bash
conda install --file conda_requirements.txt
```
See the `example.ipybn` for a simple example of how to use the module.

## Testing
```bash
pytest
```
